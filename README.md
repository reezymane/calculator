# calculator

This is a fully functional calculator! This project was to put together everything I've learned so far in The Odin Project course. This project was to test and practice my skills in setting up the html layout, styling with CSS, and using javascript to build functions for each button click. The button clicks display the numbers clicked by appending the html, run functions for each mathematical operation, and displays the answer when clicking =. The Clear button starts the calculator fresh, and the backspace button allows the user to correct typos.

Let's do some math!
